* Functionalities

The plugin can be used to map the deforestation risk for a country or
area of interest. Four models can be used to derive the map: iCAR,
GLM, RandomForest, and Moving Window models. All models are calibrated
using past deforestation observations for a given period of time
between 2000 and 2022. Forest cover change maps can be provided by the
user or derived from two global tree cover or forest change products:
[[https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest][Global Forest Change]] and [[https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/TMF][Tropical Moist Forests]].
