about=The deforisk QGIS plugin can be used to map the deforestation risk for a country or area of interest. Four models can be used to derive the risk maps: the iCAR, GLM, Random Forest, and Moving Window models. These four models can be compared to a benchmark model which assumes a simple decrease of the deforestation risk with distance to forest edge. All models are calibrated using past deforestation observations for a given period of time. Forest cover change maps can be provided by the user or derived from two global tree/forest cover change products: Global Forest Change and Tropical Moist Forests. The plugin relies on several Python packages developed specifically for modelling and forecasting deforestation, in particular the forestatrisk and riskmapjnr packages.
