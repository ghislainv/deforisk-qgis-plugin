Open QGIS on your computer. To have access to log messages, activate the "Log Messages" panel in QGIS going to =View > Panel > Log Messages= in the Menu. When using a plugin, it is also a good habit to open the Python console in QGIS to have access to Python messages returned in the console. To open it, click on the Python icon @@rst:|ico_py|@@ in the "Plugins Toolbar". If the toolbar is not visible, activate it going to =View > Toolbars > Plugins Toolbar= in the Menu.

Once the plugin has been installed (see [[file:installation.html][Installation]] instructions), open the plugin clicking on its icon @@rst:|ico_deforisk|@@. You should see the versions of the dependencies installed in your environment written in the Python console. Check that these version numbers correspond to the last version for each dependency. Otherwise upgrade the dependencies.

To test the plugin and have a first look at its functionalities, try it on a small area of interest (AOI) such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique][Martinique]] island (1128 km^{2}) which has the MTQ iso code. Testing the plugin on a small AOI has the advantage of making computations fast so that you can directly see the outputs, interpret the results, and understand the functioning of the plugin.

To better understand the different steps, keep in mind that we are considering different periods and dates for model calibration and validation.

#+caption: Dates and periods used to calibrate and validate models. Modified from [[https://verra.org/methodologies/vt0007-unplanned-deforestation-allocation-udef-a-v1-0/][Verra's VT0007]]. In our case, we renamed the period from t2 to t3 as the "validation" period in place of the "confirmation" period.

Click the run button. A forest cover change map appears in the list of QGIS layers (see image below and click to enlarge) and a plot of the forest cover change ~fcc123.png~ is created in folder ~outputs/variables~. New folders are created in the working directory among which the ~data_raw~ folder which includes raw data with intermediary files and the ~data~ folder which includes processed data used for models and plots.

The deforestation risk map obtained with the iCAR model at t3 can be used to allocate deforestation after year 2020. Both the risk map with classes of deforestation from 1 to 65535 and the ~defrate_cat_icar_forecast.csv~ table with deforestation rates for all classes of deforestation risk are necessary to allocate deforestation in the future.

The table only includes values for ~rate_mod~, the relative spatial deforestation rates from the iCAR model estimated on the historical period. As for the validation step, the deforestation must be adjusted for quantity depending on the amount of deforestation expected in the future.

Considering a total deforestation $D$ (in ha) for the next $Y$ years at the jurisdictional level, the adjustment factor is $\rho = D / (A \sum_i n_{i} \theta_{m,i})$, with $A$ the pixel area in ha, the absolute rate is $\theta_{a,i} = \rho \theta_{m,i}$, and the deforestation density is $\delta_{i} = \theta_{a,i} \times A / Y$. The deforestation density $\delta_{i}$ is used to predict the amount of deforestation (in ha/yr) for each forest pixel belonging to a given class of deforestation risk for the next $Y$ years (for notations, see details [[file:plugin_api.html#defrate-table][here]]).

The risk map together with the table of computed deforestation density can be used to [[https://verra.org/verra-launches-unplanned-deforestation-allocation-tool-vt0007-issues-call-for-supplementary-materials/][proportionally allocate fractions]] of either the jurisdictional unplanned deforestation activity data baseline (in the context of [[https://verra.org/methodologies/vmd0055-estimation-of-emission-reductions-from-avoiding-unplanned-deforestation-v1-0/][VMD0055]]) or the jurisdictional FREL (in the context of the VCS [[https://verra.org/programs/jurisdictional-nested-redd-framework/][Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+]] Framework) to projects or programs to be implemented within the jurisdiction. To do so, a table with the number of pixels for each class of deforestation risk in the project area must be computed.

The ~deforisk~ QGIS plugin includes an utility to facilitate the allocation of the deforestation to projects. Before using it, you can download the vector file defining the borders of a fake project in Martinique ([[file:_static/get_started/project_borders_MTQ_jurisdiction.gpkg][project_borders_MTQ_jurisdiction.gpkg]]).

- ~Juris. risk map~: File ~prob_icar_t3.tif~ for the best risk map.
- ~Table. with defor. rates~: File ~defrate_cat_icar_forecast.csv~ for the table with the deforestation rates from the icar model at t3 for each class of deforestation risk.
- ~Project borders~: File ~project_borders_MTQ_jurisdiction.gpkg~.
- ~Juris. deforestation (ha)~: 4000. About 400 ha have been deforested each year in 2010--2020 in Martinique. 
- ~Length forecast period (yr)~: 10.
  
Pushing the ~Run~ button in this box computes the quantity adjustment factor and the deforestation density for each class of risk using the total expected deforestation at the jurisdictional level ($D=4000$)and the relative spatial deforestation rates from the model. Then, 
the risk map with classes of deforestation risk is cropped to project borders and the number of forest pixels in each class of risk is computed at the project level. Finally, the expected deforestation at the project level is obtained summing the deforestation densities within the project.

A folder ~outputs/allocating_deforestation~ is created with the file ~defor_project.csv~ indicating the predicted deforestation (106.7 ha) for the period 2020--2030 for the project:
