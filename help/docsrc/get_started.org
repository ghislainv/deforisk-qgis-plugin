* Introduction

To test the plugin installation and have a first look at its functionalities, try it on a small area of interest (AOI) such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique][Martinique]] island (1128 km^{2}) which as the MTQ iso code. Testing the plugin on a small AOI has the advantage of making computations faster so that you can directly see the outputs, interpret the results, and understand the functioning of the plugin.
