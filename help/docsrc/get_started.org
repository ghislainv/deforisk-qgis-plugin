Open QGIS on your computer. To have access to log messages, activate the "Log Messages" panel in QGIS going to =View > Panel > Log Messages= in the Menu. When using a plugin, it is also a good habit to open the Python console in QGIS to have access to Python messages returned in the console. To open it, click on the Python icon @@rst:|ico_py|@@ in the "Plugins Toolbar". If the toolbar is not visible, activate it going to =View > Toolbars > Plugins Toolbar= in the Menu.

Once the plugin has been installed (see [[file:installation.html][Installation]] instructions), open the plugin clicking on its icon @@rst:|ico_deforisk|@@. You should see the versions of the dependencies installed in your environment written in the Python console. Check that these version numbers correspond to the last version for each dependency. Otherwise upgrade the dependencies.

To test the plugin and have a first look at its functionalities, try it on a small area of interest (AOI) such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique][Martinique]] island (1128 km^{2}) which has the MTQ iso code. Testing the plugin on a small AOI has the advantage of making computations fast so that you can directly see the outputs, interpret the results, and understand the functioning of the plugin.

- ~Working directory~: Select your working directory. Here ~/home/<username>/deforisk/MTQ-tuto~, but it could be ~C:\Users\<username>\deforisk\MTQ-tuto~ on Windows for example.
- ~Area Of Interest~: MTQ
- ~Years~: 2000, 2010, 2020
- ~Forest data source~: tmf
- ~Tree cover threshold (%)~: 50 (could be left empty, not useful here for tmf data source) 
- ~Tile size (dd)~: 1
- ~Country/state ISO code~: MTQ 
- ~Earth Engine access~: Google Cloud project name with Earth Engine access or path to a JSON private key file for service account.
- ~WDPA access~: Personal WDPA API Token or path to text file with WDPA_KEY environmental variable.

Click the run button. A forest cover change map appears in the list of QGIS layers (see image below and click to enlarge) and a plot of the forest cover change ~fcc123.png~ is created in folder ~outputs/variables~. New folders are created in the working directory among which the ~data_raw~ folder which includes raw data with intermediary files and the ~data~ folder which includes processed data used for models and plots. You can visualize the road network for example adding the ~roads_proj.shp~ vector file, which is located in the ~data_raw~ directory, in QGIS.

* Benchmark model

[[file:_static/get_started/interface-benchmark.png]]

** Fit model to data

- ~Deforestation threshold (%)~: 99.5%
- ~Max. distance to forest edge (m)~: 2500
- ~calib. period~: Checked, the model is fitted over the calibration period (t1--t2).
- ~hist. period~: Checked, the model is fitted over the historical period (t1--t3).

Click the ~Run~ button to estimate the deforestation risk with the benchmark model and predict the deforestation risk at t1 using data on both the calibration and historical periods. Maps with classes of deforestation risk are added to the list of QGIS layers (see image below) and new folders with results are created in the ~outputs/rmj_benchmark/~ directory including the ~<period>/defrate_cat_bm_<period>.csv~ tables with deforestation rates for each class of deforestation risk (see details [[file:plugin_api.html#defrate-table][here]]).

** Predict the deforestation risk

- ~t2 validation~: Checked, computes predictions at t2 for validation (using the benchmark model fitted over the calibration period).
- ~t3 forecast~: Checked, computes predictions at t3 for forecasting (using the benchmark model fitted over the historical period).

Click the ~Run~ button to predict the deforestation risk at t2 and t3 using the benchmark model. Maps with classes of deforestation risk are added to the list of QGIS layers (see image below) and new folders with results are created in the ~outputs/rmj_benchmark/~ directory.

** Predict the deforestation risk

- ~iCAR model~: Checked, computes predictions with the iCAR model.
- ~GLM~: Checked, computes predictions with GLM.
- ~RF model~: Checked, computes predictions with the Random Forest model.
- ~t1 calibration~: Checked, computes predictions at t1 using models fitted over the calibration period.

New folders are created ~outputs/far_models/validation~ and ~outputs/far_models/forecast~. They include the ~<period>/defrate_cat_<model>_<period>.csv~ tables with deforestation rates for each class of deforestation risk (see details [[file:plugin_api.html#defrate-table][here]]).

* Moving window models

[[file:_static/get_started/interface-mw.png]]

** Fit model to data

- ~Deforestation threshold (%)~: 99.5%
- ~Max. distance to forest edge (m)~: 2500
- ~Window sizes (# pixels)~: 11, 21
- ~calib. period~: Checked, the model is fitted over the calibration period (t1--t2).
- ~hist. period~: Checked, the model is fitted over the historical period (t1--t3).

Click the ~Run~ button to estimate the deforestation risk with the moving window model using data on both the calibration and historical periods. New folders with results are created in the ~outputs/rmj_moving_window/~ directory including the ~<period>/ldefrate_mw_<window_size>.tif~ raster file with local deforestation rates rescaled on [2, 65535].

** Predict the deforestation risk

- ~t2 validation~: Checked, computes predictions at t2 for validation (using the moving window model fitted over the calibration period).
- ~t3 forecast~: Checked, computes predictions at t3 for forecasting (using the moving window model fitted over the historical period).

Click the ~Run~ button to predict the deforestation risk at t2 and t3 using the moving window model. Maps with classes of deforestation risk are added to the list of QGIS layers (see image below) and new folders with results are created in the ~outputs/rmj_moving_window/~ directory, including the ~<period>/defrate_cat_mv_<window_size>_<period>.csv~ tables with deforestation rates for each class of deforestation risk (see details [[file:plugin_api.html#defrate-table][here]]).

* Validation

- ~Coarse grid cell size (# pixels)~: 50, 100
- ~iCAR model~: Checked, estimates the performance of the iCAR model.
- ~GLM~: Checked, estimates the performance of the GLM.
- ~RF model~: Checked, estimates the performance of the Random Forest model.
- ~MW model~: Checked, estimates the performance of the Moving Window models.
- ~calib. period~: Checked, estimates model performances for the calibration period (t1--t2).
- ~valid. period~: Checked, estimates model performances for the validation period (t2--t3).
- ~hist. period~: Checked, estimates model performances for the historical period (t1--t3).

Pushing the ~Run~ button in this box will compute the predicted deforested area in each grid cell for each model and each period selected and compare this value to the observed deforested area for the same grid cell and period.

New folders are created for each period: ~outputs/model_validation/<period>/figures~ and ~outputs/model_validation/<period>/tables~. Several output files are added to each folder including files ~figures/pred_obs_<model>_<period>_<cell_size>.png~ which show the plot of predicted vs. observed deforested area. The plot shows values of predicted and observed deforested area in each grid cell as points and the one-one line. The plot reports also the number of grid cells (or points), and the values of two of the performance indices: the $R^{2}$ and the MedAE.
