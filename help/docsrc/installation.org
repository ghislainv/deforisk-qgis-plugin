* Installation

#+attr_rst: :directive note
#+begin_quote
[[https://www.qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]] and [[https://gdal.org/index.html][GDAL]] must be installed on your system. The ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ Python packages must also be installed on your system before using the QGIS plugin. Follow the instructions below to install these dependencies on your system.

** On Windows

*** Turn on the developer mode

To be able to use the ~deforisk~ QGis plugin, you need to activate the developer mode on Windows. The developer mode allows creating symbolic links (symlinks) which are used by the plugin and necessary to avoid copying large files on disk. To activate the developer mode, follow [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development][these instructions]]. In summary:
- Enter "for developers" into the search box in the taskbar to go to the "For developers" settings page.
- Toggle the Developer Mode setting, at the top of the "For developers" page.
- Read the disclaimer for the setting you choose. Click "Yes" to accept the change.
  
*** Install QGIS and GDAL on Windows

To install QGIS and GDAL on Windows, use the [[https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/][OSGeo4W]] network installer. OSGeo4W is a binary distribution of a broad set of open source geospatial software for Windows environments (Windows 11 down to 7). Select /Express Install/ and install both QGIS and GDAL. Several Gb of space will be needed on disk to install these programs. This will also install /OSGeo4W Shell/ to execute command lines.

*** Install the ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ Python packages on Windows

To install the ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ Python packages, open /OSGeo4W Shell/, upgrade ~pip~ and ~setuptools~, and install ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ with ~pip~.

#+begin_src shell
python3.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
python3.exe -m pip install forestatrisk riskmapjnr
#+end_src

Note: In case of problems, you can check the version of Python used by OSGeo4W using /OSGeo Shell/ and that the package wheels for ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ are available on [[https://pypi.org/project/forestatrisk/#files][PyPI]] for your Windows and Python versions. Currently, PyPI provides wheels for Python 3.9 to 3.11 for Windows, Linux, and macOS 64-bit systems.

#+begin_src shell
python3.exe --version
#+end_src

** On Unix-like systems (Linux and macOS)

*** Install QGIS and GDAL on Unix-like systems

Install QGIS and GDAL on your system, for example using ~apt-get~ for Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions.

#+begin_src shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qgis gdal-bin libgdal-dev
#+end_src

After installing GDAL, you can test the installation by running ~gdalinfo --version~ in the command prompt or terminal, which should display the installed GDAL version.

*** Install the ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ Python packages on Unix-like systems

On recent systems, you cannot use pip to install Python packages system-wide. As a consequence, we need to create a virtual environment and install the ~forestatrisk~ and ~riskmapjnr~ packages in it. Make sure to also install the appropriate GDAL bindings using ~gdal==$(gdal-config --version)~. Once the package and its dependencies have been installed, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

#+begin_src shell
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
source  /path/to/venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install forestatrisk riskmapjnr gdal==$(gdal-config --version)
deactivate
#+end_src

Then, in the ~startup.py~ [[https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/intro.html#running-python-code-when-qgis-starts][Python file]], add the following two lines, adapting the path to your specific case (check the Python version). These two lines will be executed when QGIS starts and will add the path to the packages installed in the virtual environment to ~sys.path~.

#+begin_src python :results output :exports both
import sys
sys.path.append("/path/to/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/")
#+end_src

** Installing the ~deforisk~ plugin in QGIS

- Download the ~deforisk~ [[https://github.com/ghislainv/deforisk-qgis-plugin/archive/refs/heads/main.zip][zip file]] from GitHub.
- Open QGIS.
- In QGIS menu bar, go to ~Extensions/Install extensions/Install from ZIP~.
- Select the zip file that has been downloaded.
