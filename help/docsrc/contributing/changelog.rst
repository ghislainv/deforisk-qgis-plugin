deforisk v2.0
-------------

- This version has been prepared for the Bangkok workshop in Thailand (March, 17th--21th of 2025).

- We simplified the use of the plugin when the user wants to use its own data.

- There is now the possibility to prepare the data and run the plugin without an internet connexion if the user provides the forest cover change data and the area of interest.

- There is now a possibility to test a simple model with only the distance to forest edge as an explanatory variable in FAR models.

- An option to get the deforestation density map (in ha/pixel/year) has been added.

- Activating the developer mode is now recommended and not mandatory (files are copied if symlinks connot be created). As a consequence, the user does not need administrator rights to use the plugin on Windows.

- We have updated the website and documentation.

- The website and documentation are now available in three languages: English, Spanish and French.

- Some bugs have been corrected.
